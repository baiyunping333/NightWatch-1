Campaign-based
  Individual battles
  Set length (chosen at start or dynamic?)

Character
  Level 1 Peon

  Possible class names:
    Peon, Spellcaster, Wizard, Necromancer, Illusionist
  No chosen class, class-name evolves

  Cracking locks (minor), Negotiations (persuading, intimidating), Exploring


Abilities
  Skill points spent allows abilities to be learned and upgraded(?)
  Limited passive ability slots (same for active?)
  Separate abilities into skill sets

Item
  Crafting
    Being able to craft items of importance, not gimped
  Using an item for a certain amount of time allows you to earn an ability from it
    As character earns experience, item gains experience
    Ex: Poison Resist 15% on item, can be learned as passive ability once used long enough on an item that has it.
  Lock item set once in combat
